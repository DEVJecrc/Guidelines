​
DEV JECRC Community is made by some students of JECRC University to spread the idea and establish an environment of programming and coding in University by learning and helping by contrubuting to our repos.
​
Start by looking at the repositories at https://github.com/DEVJECRC. Select a repo that you find interesting and pickup one of the issues that seems suitable. But even before that you can join our #DEVJECRC/general gitter channel and talk with us. So just drop by and say a Hi!
​
If you are a newcomer we recommend choosing a difficulty/newcomer issue to get started.
